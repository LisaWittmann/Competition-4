In this document, we will elucidate our approach for achieving this aim and outline the sequential stages involved in constructing the model. The targeted emotions for prediction encompass happiness, anger, sadness, and disgust. We have sourced our image data from the well-established Cohn-Kanade database, which comprises static images extracted from videos wherein individuals were instructed to convey these four distinct emotions through their facial expressions. The database was designed with the explicit purpose of facilitating machine learning endeavors, specifically for training and testing algorithms geared towards automated emotion classification.\n\n\n### 2.2 Dataset\nThe dataset we are working with is derived from the CK+ database, a well-established resource containing images and videos of individuals expressing various emotions. Our dataset comprises a total of 2,538 images in the training set and 1,080 images in the test set.\n\nTo facilitate image processing, we have structured these images as long vectors, with pixel intensities arranged row by row. Each image in the training set is also accompanied by an emotion label, categorizing it into emotions like anger, disgust, happiness, and sadness.\n\nFor the purpose of diversifying our training data and providing variations from different angles, certain images have been duplicated and subjected to slight rotations. All the images are monochromatic and have been standardized to a size of 48x48 pixels. It's important to note that the images we've used are a carefully curated subset of the CK+ database.\n\n### 2.3 Candidate Machine Learning Models and Features\nThe classification task on hand deals with a multiple classification problem - people expressing the four emotions. Furthermore, we are working with the raw pixels and therefore will face a lot of features, which we can derive from the visual outline. Therefore we chose the following features to include in those models: \n\n- **histogram features**: We created a document-by-term matrix which contains \n\n\nAnd our predictions of facial expressions were based on the following models: \n\n- Ridge Multinominal Regression <br>\n- Linear Discriminant Analysis <br>\n- Classification Tree <br>\n- Random Forest <br>\n- Support Vector Machines]\n\n### 2.4 Bayes' error bound\nTo get an idea of the minimum accuracy we should aim for (the Bayes bound), we can look at how good humans are at recognizing emotions from facial expressions. Our brains are pretty good at this because we have a built-in understanding of emotions, and we see faces as a whole picture, not just a bunch of separate features like eyes, nose, and lips. This holistic view helps us make more accurate emotional guesses.\n\nOn the other hand, machine learning algorithms analyze individual features without really understanding the big emotional picture. Plus, we humans have our own emotions and can easily connect facial expressions to feelings. Algorithms can't do that.\n\nSo, to figure out the Bayes bound, we need to know how often humans get it right. In a study by Mollahosseini and others in 2018, they checked how often human judges correctly guessed 11 emotions. For the emotions in our dataset, here are the percentages they identified correctly:\n\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n    <tr><td>disgust</td><td>anger</td><td>happy</td><td>sad</td></tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr><td>67.6%</td><td>62.3%</td><td>79.6%</td><td>69.7%</td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n\nOur estimated accuracy serves as as the \"Bayes bound\" or the best performance we can reasonably expect. This suggests that a very good machine learning model is unlikely to outperform humans in recognising these emotions from facial expressions. We compute the probable overall Bayes bound for this specific dataset, which amounts to 71%.\n\nEstimated Accuracy = [(0.623 * 570) + (0.676 * 744) + (0.796 * 870) + (0.697 * 354)] / (2538) * 100% â‰ˆ 71%","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.5 Data Import","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we load image data, where it reads image files and stores pixel values in a matrix X.

Edges are most effectively identified in grayscale images because they filter out variations in illumination and different skin colors. These variations can facilitate emotion recognition.\n\nHistogram features are particularly effective when applied to edges. To detect edges, we examine the rapid changes in pixel intensities. By computing the difference between two consecutive pixels and checking if it exceeds a certain threshold, we can locate the pixels representing the edges of abrupt intensity changes. This process can be performed in various directions, such as north, south, west, east, north-west, and south-west. However, to simplify the process, it suffices to compute differences in just two directions: north and west (or alternatively, south and east). These directions help identify horizontal and vertical edges, effectively filtering out pixels that are part of diagonal edges.\n\nThe FreySlateFeatures are computed by applying the edges function to X.

The key data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors and play a pivotal role in defining the decision boundary. \nThe support vector machine methode is simple, however the disadvantage is that it can not be applied to most data sets.
